# Data Analysis with Pandas & Visualization with Matplotlib

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization.
The goal is to load, explore, clean, and analyze a dataset, then present insights through clear and meaningful visualizations.

## Objectives
Load & Explore Data
Import dataset from CSV format.
Inspect the first rows with .head().
Explore dataset structure and check for missing values.
Handle missing data by filling or dropping values.
Perform Basic Data Analysis
Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
Use .describe() for summary statistics.
Group data by categories (e.g., species, region, department) and calculate aggregate metrics.
Identify patterns and insights from grouped results.
## Data Visualization

Line Chart → Show trends over time (e.g., sales trends).
Bar Chart → Compare values across categories.
Histogram → Show distribution of numerical values.
Scatter Plot → Display relationships between two variables.
Customize charts with titles, axis labels, and legends for clarity.
## Tools & Libraries

Python
Pandas → Data manipulation & cleaning
Matplotlib → Data visualization

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
Understand how to load and explore datasets with Pandas.
Learn how to clean and prepare data for analysis.
Apply grouping and aggregation to uncover insights.
Visualize data effectively using different chart types.
Build practical experience in data analysis workflows.
